## Languages that compile to Lua
Lua is famously and deceptively simple and enables many different programming paradigms. Like Javascript, it's possible to make it shine by adding more specialized syntax. I started this list to document the languages I found looking for an ML/F# like language.

Note: Unmaintained languages have been marked with (*) and Archived languages have been marked with (^)

Pull requests welcome!

### Compile to bytecode
An intriguing new avenue of development started by [Rochus Keller](https://github.com/rochus-keller) for an Oberon to LuaJIT bytecode compiler provides an elegant way of leveraging the ecosystem:
 - https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/
  Oberon compiler
 - (*) https://github.com/franko/luajit-lang-toolkit
  A Lua to LuaJIT bytecode compiler/toolkit to enable different language frontends and different compilation backends.
 - https://github.com/rochus-keller/LjTools 
  LuaJIT tools, a Qt5 GUI parser, browser, assembler and test VM for LuaJIT 2.0 bytecode

### VM forks
 - https://github.com/mingodad/ljs *ljs* JS-like syntax with modified VMs for PUC Lua, LuaJIT and RaptorJIT
 - https://github.com/PlutoLang/Pluto A superset of Lua 5.4 â€” with unique features, optimizations, and improvements.

### Tier 1

 - http://yuescript.org/
 Yuescript, an extended and actively developed form of Moonscript.

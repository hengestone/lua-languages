## Languages that compile to Lua
Lua is famously and deceptively simple and enables many different programming paradigms. Like Javascript, it's possible to make it shine by adding more specialized syntax. I started this list to document the languages I found looking for an ML/F# like language.

Pull requests welcome!

### Tier 1
For lack of a better designator, these projects are well known, or compiles existing languages
 - http://moonscript.org/
 Moonscript, indentation based syntax, based on coffeescript
 - http://haxe.org
 Haxe, strongly typed OO language transpiler with multiple backends
 - https://github.com/yanghuan/CSharp.lua
 C# transpiler
 - https://github.com/retroverse/Venus
 Go-like language
 - https://github.com/gijit/gi translates Go into Lua. It targets LuaJIT for 64-bit integer support.
